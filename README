sizeof - a tiny tool for calculating the sizes of files and folders

	sizeof [-bfisBFIS] FILE ...

	Options (capitalize to negate):
	b - print bytes (no K, M, G, or T)
	f - print file name (default)
	i - print with base 2 units (default)
	s - sum all sizes together

Instead of calculating disk usage like du, sizeof only measures file length.
You'll need the %llu format directive and a few POSIX functions to use sizeof.
